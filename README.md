## General info
This project is a recruitment task. The project was made in accordance with the guidelines. An application allows to build forms with subforms. There are 3 types of conditions for an answer. An answer input in subform is relative to the condition of the parent form.

## Additional info
Unfortunately, I was unable to finish the project completely. I used IndexedDB for the first time and I did not make it before deadline. The data and a persitant state for the form objects are not stored anywhere.  Anyway, I uploaded my work files as well to the "unfinished_version" folder.

* HTML5
* CSS3 (SASS)
* JavaScript
* ReactJS
